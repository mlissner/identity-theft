Identity Theft
==============

This repository serves to document and solve my ID theft that began in May of last year. I'm using GitHub for this for two reasons:

1. I'm on hold endlessly during this process and can't really do much else.
2. More to the point: There are a bunch of things that need to be taken care of, and doing so via GitHub issues actually makes a lot of sense. 

And so, without further ado, allow me to explain what's going on.

History
-------

Around June of last year, I got a phone call from "PayPal" telling me that I needed to pay my credit card bill with them. I was convinced at the time that it wasn't actually PayPal, and that it was a scam phone call. I was wrong about that. The scam had happened earlier, I **did** have a PayPal credit card that somebody had created in my name, and it was indeed overdue. 

Months later, I got another phone call, again trying to get me to pay off the PayPal credit card. At this point, I was just impressed with the scammer's persistence, but I didn't pursue it further, and left on a six month trip to New Zealand.

...

In May of this year, back from New Zealand, I got another call, this time from a debt collector. Alarm bells went off when they were able to tell me my SSN, DOB, address, previous address...everything. It was time to dig in and see what was happening, so I began checking my credit reports.

Sure enough, each of the credit reports listed a long overdue PayPal credit card that was opened in May, 2013. Bummer.

Resolution
----------

Resolving this situation has been painful. There are several issues:

1. I need to [clear things up with the bank that PayPal uses to issue these credit cards][1]
2. I need to <a href="https://github.com/mlissner/identity-theft/issues/2"><s>create an immediate 90 day security hold with each of the credit agencies</s></a>.  
3. I need to [~~create a police report~~][10] and an [~~affidavit with the FTC~~][11] -- these form my "Identity Theft Report".
3. I need to set up a seven year security block with the [three][3] [credit][4] [agencies][5] (a more involved process than above).
5. I need to block the credit card from appearing on my credit report with each of the [three][6] [credit][7] [agencies][8].
6. I need to get the [debt collector off my back][9].

All of these things are under way. You can watch the progress!
